## Introduction
Proxmox VE is an excellent choice for creating and managing a home lab due to its ease of use, flexibility, and powerful feature set, including support for both VMs and containers. This guide will walk you through the process of installing and configuring Proxmox VE for your homelab, from hardware setup to managing VMs and containers.

## Hardware Requirements
To run Proxmox VE efficiently, the following hardware is recommended:
- **CPU**: 64-bit processor with Intel VT-x/AMD-V support
- **RAM**: Minimum 4GB, but 16GB or more is recommended for multiple VMs/containers
- **Storage**: SSD or NVMe drive for fast performance, with additional storage for VMs/containers
- **Network**: A reliable Ethernet connection, with optional VLAN support for advanced networking configurations

## Software Requirements
- **Proxmox VE ISO**: Download from the official [Proxmox website](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads).
- **Etcher or Rufus**: To create a bootable USB drive from the ISO.
- **Web browser**: To access the Proxmox VE web interface.

## Installation
1. **Create a Bootable USB Drive**: Use Etcher or Rufus or use a Ventoy drive to flash the Proxmox VE ISO onto a USB drive.
   ```bash
   etcher Proxmox-VE.iso /dev/sdx
2. **Boot from USB**: Insert the bootable USB drive into your server and boot from it.

3. **Install Proxmox**: Follow the on-screen instructions to install Proxmox onto your selected storage device.

4. **Access Web Interface**: After installation, access the Proxmox web interface by navigating to `https://<your-server-ip>:8006` in a browser.

## Post-Installation Configuration

**Configure Storage**: Set up local storage or connect to network-attached storage (NAS) for managing your VM/Container data.

**Update Proxmox**: Run updates to ensure you have the latest security patches and features:
  ```bash
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
```
Enable No-Subscription Repository: If you're using the free version, configure the no-subscription repository:


## Networking
Bridge Configuration: Set up a network bridge to allow VMs and containers to communicate with other devices on your network.

VLAN Support: Configure VLANs if you are using multiple network segments for VMs and containers.

## VM and Container Setup
Create a VM: Using the web interface, create a new VM for services such as Jellyfin, Minecraft, or others.

LXC Containers: Use LXC containers for lightweight services such as Pi-hole or Home Assistant.

## Backup and Recovery
Backup Strategy: Set up regular backups of your VMs and containers to avoid data loss. Use Proxmox's built-in backup feature to schedule backups.

Restore: In case of failure, restore your VMs/containers from the backup files.

## Monitoring and Management
Proxmox Web Interface: Use the Proxmox web interface for real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, and disk usage.

Proxmox CLI: Use Proxmox command-line tools for advanced management tasks:

Alerts and Notifications: Set up email or webhook alerts for system events or failures.
